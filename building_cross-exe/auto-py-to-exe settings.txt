How to build the cross-executables for the Python parts of h2aFreeplane

1. Start auto-py-to-exe to compile the Python scripts to executables
    Linux:
    run "auto-py-to-exe" in the terminal

    Windows:
    Open auto-py-to-exe if multiple python versions are installed: [https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/]
    run "python -m auto_py_to_exe" in the terminal

2. Auto Py to Exe - GUI (the resulting folder is easily 1 GB, so run the command directly on your hard drive)
    - "Path to File" select the file "h2aFreeplane_caller.py"
    - run auto-py-to-exe with default settings (onedir, console-based, ...)
    - "Open output folder" copy the executable "h2aFreeplane_caller" and all relevant folders and files to the repo ("relevant" means that it is necessary to run the exe, either use trial and error, check the files in the repo, or consult the internet)

    - execute the same procedure for "h2a_update_from_Freeplane_caller.py"
